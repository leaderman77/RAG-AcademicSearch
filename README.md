# RAG-AcademicSearch
Development and Evaluation of RAG-powered Academic Literature Search Assistant application with Arxiv papers

# Introduction to RAG:
•	Definition: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines real-time data retrieval with advanced natural language processing to generate responses that are contextually enriched by the most relevant information available.
# Benefits of RAG:
•	Up-to-date Information: Unlike Large Language Models (LLMs) that are static and become outdated, RAG provides current information by retrieving from the latest documents.
•	Resource Efficiency: Training or fine-tuning LLMs demands substantial computational power and time. RAG, by leveraging retrieval, can provide improved outcomes without the extensive resources required for training large models.
•	Data Security: RAG can be designed to operate within an organization's private databases, ensuring that sensitive or confidential information is securely accessed and not exposed in the process.
•	Reduction of Hallucinations: LLMs can sometimes "hallucinate" by generating plausible but factually incorrect or nonsensical information. RAG mitigates this by grounding responses in sourced data, enhancing reliability and factual accuracy.

# API: For papers the application will connect to arxiv.org via its API to get papers.

# Project Scope:
## 1.	Primary Objective: To create an intelligent search assistant application that leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to provide users with concise, relevant summaries of academic papers based on their search queries.
2.	Secondary Objective: To assess the performance of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application in the context of academic literature search and to explore methodologies for evaluating its effectiveness.
3.	Target User Group: Academics, researchers, and students who require efficient tools to aid in the literature review process and enhance the quality of their research.
4.	Core Features:
•	A query input interface for users to submit their research questions.
•	A retrieval system that searches an extensive database of academic papers.
•	A summarization feature that condenses the findings of papers into digestible insights.
•	A results presentation module that ranks summaries and links to full documents.
•	An interactive follow-up query system for deep-diving into specific topics.
•	Comparative analysis of different evaluation methodologies to determine their effectiveness in assessing the RAG model.
•	A contingency plan to train the RAG model, should resources and time permit, to refine the search results further.
5.	Data Handling: Collection, preparation, and maintenance of a comprehensive and up-to-date database of academic literature.
6.	User Interface: Development of a user-friendly front-end that facilitates easy submission of queries and navigation of results.
7.	Performance and Adaptability: The system will be designed to handle a high volume of queries with quick response times and adapt to user feedback for improved search accuracy.
8.	Data Management:
•	Use of a vector database in the cloud to store retrieved papers and their embeddings, optimizing the search and retrieval process.
•	A cost-effective approach to data storage that balances budget constraints with the need for quick and efficient data retrieval.
9.	Evaluation Metrics:
•	Accuracy of search results in terms of relevance and comprehensiveness.
•	User satisfaction and usability based on feedback from a diverse group of test users.
•	Computational efficiency, considering response times and resource utilization.
10.	Research Focus: Intense focus on the evaluation aspect, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative metrics to assess the RAG application's performance in real-world scenarios.
11.	Project Deliverables:
•	A detailed report on the evaluation results of the RAG application.
•	A possible model training module, dependent on a subsequent decision based on time and resource evaluation.
•	A guideline document outlining best practices and recommendations for using and evaluating RAG applications in academic settings.
12.	Exclusions: The project will not extend to the development of new methodologies for RAG models but will focus on the application and evaluation of existing ones.
13.	Constraints: The project is bound by the limited resources for training the RAG model and will proceed with the training phase only if it's deemed feasible within the given constraints.
14.	Success Criteria:
•	Delivery of the application within the stipulated timeline and budget.
•	Achievement of a high level of accuracy in the retrieval and summarization of papers.
•	Positive feedback from a user testing group representative of the target audience.
•	Comprehensive evaluation of the RAG application with detailed documentation of findings.
•	Development of a cost-effective and efficient vector database storage solution.
•	Demonstration of potential improvements in RAG model results, if model training is undertaken.
This project will contribute to the body of knowledge on RAG applications in academic research, with a special emphasis on evaluation techniques. It will also explore the potential for model improvement within the limits of the current resource landscape.
